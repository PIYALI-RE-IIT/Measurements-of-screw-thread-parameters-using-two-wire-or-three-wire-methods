Twoâ€“wire Method:
1.	Select two precision wires with a diameter slightly smaller than the thread groove width.
2.	Accurately measure the diameter (d) of the wire using the micrometer
3.	Select a micrometer capable of measuring wire diameters to 0.001 mm.
4.	Place the wires diametrically opposite to each other in two adjacent grooves.
5.	Measure the pitch (p) of the screw thread using a pitch gauge.
6.	Using the micrometer, measure the distance between the outer surfaces of the two wires (M).
7.	Calculate the effective diameter using the formula of E.

Three-wire method:
1.	Select three precision wires with a diameter slightly smaller than the thread groove width.
2.	Select a micrometer capable of measuring wire diameters to 0.001 mm.
3.	Accurately measure the diameter (d) of the wires using the micrometer.
4.	Measure the pitch (p) of the screw thread using a pitch gauge.
5.	Place the three wires in the thread grooves, forming an equilateral triangle:
    i)	Two wires on one side of the thread, aligned diametrically opposite each other.
    ii)	One wire on the opposite side, centered between the two wires.
6.	Using a micrometer, measure the distance between the outer surfaces of the wires (M).
7.	Using the formula, measure the value of H (height of threads) and effective diameter (E).
